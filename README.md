# git-assignment

This program starts by defining a function add that takes two numbers as inputs and returns their sum. 
Then, it takes two numbers as input from the user using the input function, which returns the input as a string. 
The int function is used to convert the input strings to integers.
Finally, the function is called by passing the two user-entered numbers as arguments, and the result is stored in a variable result. 
The result is then printed to the console using the print function.
